# YE-et-al-2023-spirals

## Description
This repository contains code for all figures in [Ye et al, 2023b](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.07.570517).
The core of code is a spiral detection algorithm. 

## Code Organization 
The preprocessing workflows are described in pipline.m files in the root folder; 
while the figure plotting functions are organized in the figure.m files.

The main functions for spiral detection are listed in the beginning of `pipeline1_spirals.m`, which are `getSpiralDetection.m` and `getSpiralGrouping.m`.
